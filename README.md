# Headphones-basic-html-css-js.
Static headphones page built with basic, pure html, css and a touch of javascript.

created a simple headphone showcase web page using HTML and CSS for layout and styling. The design includes key visual elements like:<br>
Product image<br>
Title & short description<br>
“Shop Now” button

I also integrated JavaScript to trigger an alert() message when users click the Shop button — simulating basic interaction.

Although this project is non-responsive (not yet mobile-friendly), it helped me understand:<br>
Core layout principles using Flexbox & Grid<br>
Styling UI elements with CSS<br>
Using JavaScript for basic interactivity

This project is part of my journey to become a Full Stack Web Developer, and I’ll be upgrading it soon with responsiveness and better features,just building pure,basic foundational skills.
